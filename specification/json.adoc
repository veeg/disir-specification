= Disir JSON back-end specification
Vegard Sandenge
Issue 0/1-draft

This document describes the JSON back-end specification.
The specification itself is numbered with issue and revision.
Within each issue, there will be no breaking changes to the specification.
Each revision of an issue only contains clarifying additions or non-breaking
changes to the specification.

NOTE: This issue is *NOT* stable. Any changes done between revisions on
issue 0 may be breaking.

== Introduction

The Disir JSON back-end specification is intended to define the JSON
serialization/deserialization format to represent a mold and config entry
from the Disir Core specification, in the JSON file format.

It is intended to be used as an implementation for the Disir Org specification,
providing the system with a way to install mold entries, write config entries and
serialize/deserialize the config entries to an archive.

This specification provides 4 different definitions, see separate sections for more details:

* config entry: the primary key-value only file format.
* mold entry: the definition of all elements in the config entry with the file format.
* mold namespace entry: The way to express namespaces from Disir Org.
* mold namespace override entry: Mechanism to override default values from the mold
namespace entry for the resulting config namespace entry.


=== Motivation

The following properties are sough after when defining a serialization back-end:

. Easily editable by humans through a text editor.
. Provide a suitable way of defining a mold namespace entry.
. Allow the definition of a mold namespace override entry, which changes
the default value of a key-value pair from the mold namespace entry.

== Overview and definitions

The `mold namespace override entry` is entirely a construct of this specification;
the Disir Org API only resolves a complete mold. This allows the system to provide
multiple default entries with different values than from the mold namespace entry,
without installing config entries. This fulfills the rule of thumb to not interfere
with the users config entries.

The serialization_id as defined by Disir Org for this back-end is "JSON".

== Configuration entry

The Disir Org implementation must provide a `config_base_id`, which is a file path,
based on group_id. The file system location of the config entry is a join
of this config_base_id and the entry_id, with the file extension `.json`.

.Disk location example: config_base_id = /etc/disir/config/, entry_id = user/homescreen
----
/etc/disir/config/user/homescreen.json
----

The most bare-boned config entry looks like this:

[source, JSON]
----
{}
----

That is, it is an empty, valid JSON serialization. This will fallback to default version, with
no keys provided.

=== Version

To specify which version of the mold entry this config entry was last synced with,
the `version` string key present at global scope, with a string value made up of exactly
non-negative integers, separated by a dot (`.`).

[source, JSON]
----
{
    "version" : "1.5"
}
----

=== Config

To indicate that this is a valid config entry representation, the expression of
key-value pairs is not done in global scope, but rather within the JSON Object which
is a value of the key `config` string key in global scope.

[source, JSON]
----
{
    "config" : {
        ...
    }
}
----

=== Key-value pair

To express key-value pairs in the config entry, each key is represented with a
string JSON key in the current scope. The JSON value of this key mimics the value type
of the key-value pair as defined by the mold.
That is, if the mold entry defines this key-value
as either String or Enum, the JSON value type is also a String.
If the key-value type is boolean, the JSON value type is boolean.
If the key-value type is float, the JSON value type is float,
and finally, if the key-value type is numeric, the JSON value type is numeric.

If the maximum number of entries of this key-value is greater than 1 for the current
version, the value shall be represented as a JSON Array type, where each element
of the array represent the index of multiple entries for this key, where the value
is the equivalent JSON value as described above.

.Example: Each key-value type with maximum 1 entry.
[source, JSON]
----
{
    "config" : {
        "key_boolean" : True,
        "key_float" : 3.14,
        "key_integer" : 42,
        "key_string" : "Bring",
        "key_enum" : "Icecream"
    }
}
----

.Example: Integer key-value type with 3 instances of the same key.
[source, JSON]
----
{
    "config" : {
        "open_ports" : [3660, 9000, 9001]
    }
}
----

=== Section

To express a section in the config entry, each section name is represented with a
string JSON key in the current scope. The JSON value is a JSON Object which opens up
a new scope that may again contain key-value pairs or sections.

If the maximum number of entries of this section is greater than 1 for the current version,
the value shall be a JSON Array type, where each element
of the array represents the index of multiple entries for this section. The value
for each element in the array is the JSON Object.

.Example: Section with maximum 1 entry.
[source, JSON]
----
{
    "config" : {
        "section_test" : {
            "key_boolean" : True,
            "key_integer" : 42,
            "section_nested" : {
                "key_enum" : "Icecream"
            }
        }
    }
}
----

.Example: Section with 2 instances of the same section.
[source, JSON]
----
{
    "config" : {
        "section_test" : [{
            "key_boolean" : True,
            "key_integer" : 42
        },
        {
            "key_float" : 3.14,
            "key_string" : "Bring"
        }
        ]
    }
}
----

== Mold entry

The Disir Org implementation must provide a `mold_base_id`, which is a file path,
based on group_id. The file system location of the mold entry is a join
of this mold_base_id and the entry_id, with the file extension `.json`.

.Disk location example: mold_base_id = /etc/disir/mold/, entry_id = user/homescreen
----
/etc/disir/mold/user/homescreen.json
----

The most bare-boned mold entry looks like this:

[source, JSON]
----
{
    "mold" : {
    }
}
----

That is, it is an almost empty JSON object with a single key "mold", containing
an object.
This will fallback to default version, with no elements provided.
This is however, not so useful. To define a element on the root of the mold,
simply add a key to the mold with the name of the element, where the value
is another object.

[source, JSON]
----
{
    "mold" : {
        "system_name" : {
            ...
        }
    }
}
----

The contents of this element determines whether or not it is a keyval or a section.

=== Keyval

The available keys in the JSON object for a keyval are as follows:

[horizontal]
"type":: String representation of the keyval value type it represents.
The following mapping is done for each value type to a string value:
* Integer: "INTEGER"
* Float: "FLOAT"
* Boolean: "BOOLEAN"
* String: "STRING"
* Enum: "ENUM"

"documentation":: String of the documentation property for the keyval.

"restrictions":: See the dedicated subsection.

"introduced":: A string representation of the introduced version property of the keyval.
This entry is optional. If it is not present, the default version is assumed.
It MUST contain ONE dot (.), separating two non-negative integers.

"deprecated":: A string representation of the deprecated property of the keyval.
This entry should NOT be present unless the element is deprecated.
It MUST contain ONE dot (.), separating two non-negative integers.

"defaults":: An array of objects, where each object has the following keys
and their described values:
* "value" : A JSON object of the same type described by the "type" field above.
* "introduced" : A string representation of which version this entry in the array
holds the value derived to the config entry.
This entry is optional, If it is not present, the default version is assumed.
If present the value MUST contain ONE dot (.), separating two non-negative integers.

.Example: Mold entry with a single keyval.
[source, JSON]
----
{
    "mold" : {
        "system_name" : {
            "type" : "STRING",
            "documentation" : "The product name",
            "defaults" : [{
                "value" : "System"
            }]
        }
    }
}
----

=== Section

The available keys in the JSON object for a section are as follows:

[horizontal]
"documentation":: String of the documentation property for the section.

"restrictions":: See the dedicated subsection.

"introduced":: A string representation of the introduced version property of the section.
This entry is optional. If it is not present, the default version is assumed.
It MUST contain ONE dot (.), separating two non-negative integers.

"deprecated":: A string representation of the deprecated property of the section.
This entry should NOT be present unless the element is deprecated.
It MUST contain ONE dot (.), separating two non-negative integers.

"elements":: The presence of this key indicate that the element is a section.
Its value must be an object, which contains keys two represent elements within this section.
All values of these keys must be another object, where either the object represent a
keyval or section.

.Example: Mold entry with a single section.
[source, JSON]
----
{
    "mold" : {
        "ship" : {
            "documentation" : "Container for all things cargo ship!",
            "introduced" : "1.4",
            "restrictions" : [{
                "type" : "MAXIMUM_ENTRIES",
                "value" : 0
            }],
            "elements" : {
                ...
            }
        }
    }
}
----

=== Restrictions

The restrictions key can be present on both keyval and section elements.
It is optional in both cases.
Its value is required be an array of objects, where each object
has the following keys, and their described values.

[horizontal]
"type":: The type property of the restriction.
The following mapping is done for each type to a string value.
* RESTRICTION_EXCLUSIVE_VALUE_ENUM: "ENUM"
* RESTRICTION_EXCLUSIVE_VALUE_RANGE: "RANGE"
* RESTRICTION_EXCLUSIVE_VALUE_NUMERIC: "NUMERIC"
* RESTRICTION_INCLUSIVE_ENTRY_MIN: "MINIMUM_ENTRIES"
* RESTRICTION_INCLUSIVE_ENTRY_MAX: "MAXIMUM_ENTRIES"

"documentation":: A string of the documentation property of the restriction.

"introduced":: A string representation of the introduced version property of the restriction.
It MUST contain ONE dot (.), separating two non-negative integers.

"deprecated":: A string representation of the deprecated property of the restriction.
It MUST contain ONE dot (.), separating two non-negative integers.

"value":: The native JSON type of the restriction as described by the value property of
the restriction. Mismatched types results in an invalid document.
For RESTRICTION_EXCLUSIVE_VALUE_RANGE, the value is an array with two values,
each of the JSON type determined by the keyval type.

.Example: RESTRICTION_INCLUSIVE_ENTRY_MIN

== Mold namespace entry

The mold namespace entry fulfills the namespace requirement in Disir Org.

There is no file format differences between a mold namespace entry and
a mold entry. The provided mold_base_id from Disir Org still makes up
the base file system path.
However, the entry_id of a mold namespace entry always ends in a forward-slash (/),
which makes the joined mold_base_id and entry_id a directory.
To signify that we have a namespace entry within this directory, we
write the file named `__namespace.json`. in this directory.

.Disk location example: mold_base_id = /etc/disir/mold/, entry_id = pictures/
----
/etc/disir/mold/pictures/__namespace.json
----

== Mold namespace override entry

Given a mold namespace entry, we may generate an arbitrary number of config namespace
entries from this mold. However, they will all produce the same content of the config,
since they are derived from the same mold. As mandated by Disir Org, we cannot
as a system provider install config entries, as they are the users' property.
So, in order to derive different config entries from the same base mold namespace entry,
we introduce an override file that changes the defaults listed in the
mold namespace entry for a single entry_id.

This file is located just as any ordinary mold entry, but we require that a
mold namespace entry file also exists in the same directory as ourselves for
this to be valid.

.Disk location example: mold_base_id = /etc/disir/mold/, entry_id = pictures/cat
----
/etc/disir/mold/pictures/__namespace.json
/etc/disir/mold/pictures/cat.json
----

In order to stay faithful to the history of the mold entry, and be able to
incorporate changes made in the mold namespace entry, we must apply overrides
to the fully parsed mold namespace entry at sync point with regard to the version
of the various elements in the mold namespace entry. So, we version all changes
in the mold namespace override entry, and sync version numbers between the
mold namespace override entry and the mod namespace entry.

Example: The key 'product' in the mold namespace entry has the default value
'corn' at the namespace version "1.5". We decide to provide a mold namespace override
entry and apply a sync point between version "1.5" of the mold namespace entry and version
"1.0" of the mold namespace override entry. The key 'product' is thus marked
in the mold namespace override entry with a new value 'starch' at mold namespace override version
"1.0". If we now generate a config entry at version "1.3", the value of the key 'product'
would be 'corn', whilst if we generate a config entry at version "1.5", the value would
be 'starch'. If however, the mold namespace entry updated with a new default at version
"1.6", with the value 'butter', generating a config entry version "1.6" will result in
the key 'product' having the value 'butter'.

Each version identifier in the mold namespace override entry must be matched
with a sync version of the mold namespace entry.

The root JSON object of the contains the following keys:

[horizontal]
"sync":: An array of objects, where each object contains the following keys:
* "namespace": A string representation of the version number of the mold namespace entry
to apply overrides for.
* "override": A string representation of the version number of the mold
namespace override entry document that keys within
this document use apply the overrides synced with the mold namespace entry version of this object.

"override":: An object where each key is the name resolution scheme
defined in Disir Core to address any element, infinitely nested. The value
of this key is either another object, or an array of such objects,
containing the following keys:
* "value": A value of equivalent value type of that keyval type the key overrides.
This is the new default value for this synced version.
* "version": The version of this mold namespace override entry of which to apply
this override. The value of this version number must be present in the sync array above
as the value of the "override" key.

[source, JSON]
----
{
    "sync" : [
      {"namespace" : "1.5", "override" : "1.0"}
    ]
    "override" : {
        "product" : {
            "version : "1.0",
            "value" : "starch"
        }
    }
}
----


If the override key contains an array of objects, each object must have an
unique version among all objects within the array.

.Example: array of objects to override single key.

    "sync" : [
      {"namespace" : "1.5", "override" : "1.0"}
      {"namespace" : "1.6", "override" : "1.1"}
    ]
    "override" : {
        "product" : [{
            "version : "1.0",
            "value" : "starch"
        },
        {
            "version : "1.1",
            "value" : "acorn"
        }]
    }
}
----
